## Abstract

(10 points) 

Our project is to take a closer look at what artistic features define a group of similar artists or a specific art movement/period. We aim to take groups of artists and their works to train a model and generate a unique result representing the artists. As for our training data to start this project, it will consist of the collected paintings of all of the artists we have in question, such as the works of Dali, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Our result will be a collection of sets of GAN-generated images, each from their particular artist. These sets will ideally each have specific artistic features that define them, thus defining that artist.. We hope to see clear distinctions between the generated images from each artist / movement enough to where one could identify the artist based on the features of the generated image.

There may be some challenges in doing this, however. Many artists may have not composed a large number of paintings, making their works alone quite unsuitable for a training set for a GAN. If we are to combine several artists into one “movement” on which we run the     GAN, this dataset may end up quite heterogeneous. Moreover, some artists have had many distinct periods within their works, which can add some additional heterogeneity to the data. But, overall, this project is culturally interesting because it will reveal to us the discerning features of each art movement. Personally we were interested in what images would be created based on at least a large majority of each artist's complete works, considering each one went through many different phases and styles of work. This project will build off of the GAN material we have already covered in class and on assignment 3, and build off code such as the GAN notebook from class, and the scrape wikiArt notebook from class.

## Data and Model

(10 points) 

In the final submission, this section will describe both the data you use for this project and any pre-existing models/neural nets. For each you should provide the name, a textual description, and a link. If there is a paper (for neural net) link that as well.
### Neural Net
The model is an improved Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) model based on GANGogh model (Jones 2017).
  - [GANGogh by K. Jones 2017](https://github.com/rkjones4/GANGogh)
  - ["GANGogh: Creating Art with GANs"](https://towardsdatascience.com/gangogh-creating-art-with-gans-8d087d8f74a1)

### Training Data
The training data consists of images of artworks by art movement, scraped from WikiArt. The art movements include: Post-Impressionism, Realism (Van Gogh); Surrealism (Dali); and Cubism, Expresionism, and Surrealism (Picasso).

## Code

(20 points)

[Data Acquisition & Web Scraping Code]()
- Uses ____ and BeautifulSoup4 to scrape WikiArt artworks by art movement.

[Data Processing]()
- Processes data...picStuff.py is used to batch process images from wikiart into 64x64 pixel format readily understood by TF.

[Improved WGAN]()
- Generative model based on GANGogh that generates and classifies artwork by art movement. [From here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf) originally and then modified to create the GANGogh.

[Generative Methods]()
- The TF model outputs images as it evolves. Our model is not converging properly at the moment...😢it is starting to create forms but nothing discernible.  

[//]: # (Link each of these items to your .ipynb or .py files within this seection, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.)

## Results

(30 points) 

[//]: # (This section should summarize your results and will embed links to documentation to significant outputs. This should document both process and show artistic results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your generative art idea. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate - audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3` - written text as `.pdf`)

The images are still converging towards a real shape that is human-interpretable. Getting the GAN to works took much more work than we anticipated. There are a variety of minute technical errors which accumulate and result in huge delays. Whereas one would expect to simply download the repository, install the dependencies and run the code, it turns out that much can go wrong along the way. Formatting problems, deprecations, syntax, mismatch of versions, multiple references to single namespace, etc. However, we can start to notice some shape developping from our generator. Much like the article, we believe that part of the reason this set did not converge was due to the lack of data which was partly a result of time limitations.  We believe that using a much larger pool of paintings we could still return some interesting images in high quality. 

## Discussion

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally innovative?
- How does your generative computational approach differ from traditional art/music/cultural production? 
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- What are the ethical concerns for this form of generative art? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project.  

TF, BeautifulSoup, etc. all other libraries get imported by our code. As long as you install TF correctly it should be fine. [here is an example](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/The-Best-Way-to-Install-TensorFlow-with-GPU-Support-on-Windows-10-Without-Installing-CUDA-1187/)

- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?

DataHub is recommended. 

- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

No.
